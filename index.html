                        <p>What were the odds that day when i went for documentation and found myself a lovely new friend.I feel like, life threw you at my face and said "Here's an unexpected surprise".At the beginning Sichuan university was just a university and not getting admitted there didn't bother me much but now i feel bad because if i had got admitted then it would have been great to study with you.Will miss you ❤️

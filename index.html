                        <strong>Dear Dikshya.</strong>
                        <p>Mery Christmas my Pacemaker.I don't wheather Santa Clause is real or not but if he is then only gift that I want would be to skip the "waiting phase".Its just i want time to pass quickly and hopefully things to start working between us.And other wish would be from god to always keep you healthy,happy and fulfill your ambitions.Right now i don't have any Christmas present for you. So I am giving you myself as a gift.If you ever need anything LITERALLY anything you can remember me. Whenever you are sad,depressed, angry,tensed,upset,mood swings come to me without thinking twice and I mean it ❤️.
